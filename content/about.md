title: Hey, I am Stephan
---

I live in Berlin and work for [OneFootball](https://company.onefootball.com) leading the efforts in Data & Insights department.
In my current position I try to form a lean efficient team of different roles that all work in the analytics field, namely Data Analysts, Engineers and Scientists.

I am generally curious and keen to learn new things. Professionally :office: I want to learn more with regards to what tools and qualities make a good manager and grow in my responsibility as such.
When I am not working one can usually find me in the kitchen :cook:, running :running: or collecting stadium :stadium:.
You can connect with me on the [Futbology App](https://twitter.com/FutbologyApp).

Companies and Universities I have worked / studied for in the past include:
